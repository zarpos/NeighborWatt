# NeighborWatt: Share your energy and save money

## Description:

NeighborWatt is a blockchain-based energy exchange system that allows neighbors to share their surplus energy with each other. Users who produce more energy than they consume can sell it to their neighbors at a fair price, helping them save money and reduce their carbon footprint.

## Features and benefits:

### Stable and fair price: 
Energy prices are based on supply and demand, ensuring that users get a fair price for their energy.

### Reduced carbon footprint: 
By preventing energy waste, NeighborWatt helps reduce the community's carbon footprint.

### Cost savings: 
Users can save money by buying energy from their neighbors at a lower price than the grid.

### Sense of community: 
NeighborWatt fosters a sense of community by allowing neighbors to collaborate with each other.


## Instructions for installation and use:

To use NeighborWatt, users will need to download the mobile app and purchase an IoT device that will be installed on their electric meter. The mobile app will allow users to see their energy consumption, buy and sell energy to their neighbors, and manage their account.
